title: Executing Workflows
---

Workflows in `nanoservice-ts` are the backbone of backend logic execution. Once a workflow is defined, it can be triggered and executed seamlessly in the local development environment using HTTP triggers or other configured methods.

## What Does Workflow Execution Mean?

Workflow execution refers to the process of running a sequence of steps (nodes) defined in a workflow file. Each step is executed based on the configured flow, and outputs are passed to subsequent nodes.

## Workflow Execution Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Execution Through Triggers">
   Workflows begin execution through Triggers, which define how and when the workflow is started.
   
   For local development, workflows are executed using HTTP Triggers:
   
   Start the local development server by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Use tools like POSTMAN, curl, or any HTTP client to test workflows.
   
   The local development server listens on `http://localhost:3000` or the port defined in your project. The workflow's path is accessible at:
   
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000/{workflow-name}
   ```

   Example: If your workflow is named countries, the trigger URL will be:
   
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000/countries
   ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Context Object (ctx) Stores Data">
   The context object (`ctx`) keeps track of inputs, outputs, and workflow states as execution progresses.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   "${ctx.node-name.output}"
   ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Output is Returned">
       Once all steps are executed, the workflow produces a final result. This result is typically returned as an HTTP response.
   
   Example response for an HTTP trigger:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "success",
     "data": { ... }
   }
   ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Execution Features

| Feature                | Description                                                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sequential Execution** | Nodes execute step-by-step in the order they are defined.       |
| **Conditional Execution** | Workflows support conditional branching (e.g., IF-ELSE).         |
| **Error Handling**       | Failures in nodes can trigger fallback or alternative paths.      |
| **Real-Time Logs**      | Track node execution, inputs, and outputs in real-time.          |

## Workflow Execution Example

### Local Development Steps

1. **Run the Development Server:** Start your project in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with POSTMAN or curl:** Send an HTTP request to the workflow trigger URL.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/countries
   ```

3. **Inspect Outputs:** Check the HTTP response and workflow logs to verify execution.

## Best Practices for Workflow Execution

- **Test Locally First:** Execute workflows locally to catch errors early.
- **Use HTTP Clients:** Tools like POSTMAN or curl make it easy to test triggers.
- **Log Execution Details:** Enable logging to monitor node inputs, outputs, and execution times.
- **Optimize Nodes:** Ensure nodes perform efficiently, especially for production execution.
