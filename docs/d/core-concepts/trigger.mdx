# Available Triggers
### HTTP
The HTTP trigger listens for HTTP requests, making it ideal for creating APIs or responding to webhooks.
#### Workflow setup
```json GET Example
"trigger": {
    "http": {
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/example",
        "accept": "application/json"
    }
}
```
<ResponseField name="method" type="GET POST PATCH PUT DELETE">
    HTTP method for the trigger
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="path" type="string">
    Endpoint path where the workflow is accessible.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="accept" type="string">
    Specifies the acceptable response content type (e.g., `application/json`)
</ResponseField>
#### CTX
### Scheduled
A scheduled trigger runs workflows automatically at specific intervals, similar to cron jobs.
#### Workflow setup
```json Example to run every day at 12 AM
"trigger": {
    "schedule": {
        "cron": "0 0 * * *"
    }
}
```
<ResponseField name="cron" type="string">
    Cron expression for scheduling the job. To learn more about cron expressions, check [Cron Expression](https://crontab.guru/)
