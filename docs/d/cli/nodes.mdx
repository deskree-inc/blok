title: Node
---

**Nodes** are the core building blocks of your **nanoservice-ts** applications, encapsulating specific pieces of logic. The `blokctl` CLI provides commands to help you create and manage these Nodes efficiently, primarily through the `create node` command.

## `create node`

This command is used to scaffold a new Node within your **nanoservice-ts** project.

> <sub>**Purpose**: To generate the boilerplate files for a new Node, including its definition (`node.json`) and implementation file (e.g., `index.ts`), placing them in the appropriate directory within your project (usually `nodes/`).</sub>

**Usage**:

```bash
# This command creates a new node and automatically generates a new directory for it.
npx blokctl@latest create node
```
```bash
# Use this command to create a new node inside the current (empty) directory.
npx blokctl@latest create node .
```

### 1. Interactive Prompts & Options

You will be prompted to provide the following information:

1. **Node Name**  
    Enter a unique name for the node (e.g., `fetch`).

2. **Select Runtime**  
    Choose between:
    - **TypeScript (recommended)** *(Default)*
    - **Python3** *(Alpha version, MacOS & Linux only)*  
    *(For this guide, select **TypeScript**.)*

3. **Select Blok Type**  
    Choose between:
    - **Module** *(For npm-published nodes â€“ not needed for this guide)*
    - **Class** *(Default, for local nodes)*

4. **Select Template**  
    Choose between:
    - **Class (recommended)** *(Default)*
    - UI - EJS - REACTJS - TailwindCSS *(not required for this guide)*

### 2. Navigate to the New Node Directory:

Once the node is created, navigate to its directory:

```bash
cd src/nodes/fetch
```

### 3. Update the Node Class Name

Open the `index.ts` file inside the node directory and **update the class name** to match your node name (`Fetch` in this example):

```typescript
// Original class name
export default class Node extends NanoService {
     ...
}

// Updated class name
export default class Fetch extends NanoService {
     ...
}
```

### 4. Register the Node in the `Nodes.ts` File

To make your node available in workflows, **register it inside `src/Nodes.ts`**:

```typescript
import ApiCall from "@blok-ts/api-call";
import IfElse from "@blok-ts/if-else";
import type { NodeBase } from "@blok-ts/shared";
import Fetch from "./nodes/fetch";

const nodes: {
     [key: string]: NodeBase;
} = {
     "@blok-ts/api-call": new ApiCall(),
     "@blok-ts/if-else": new IfElse(),
     "fetch": new Fetch()
};

export default nodes;
```

### 5. Validate the Node

To verify that your new node has been registered correctly, run the following command from the root of your project:
```bash
npm run dev
```
If everything works as expected, the node is ready to be used in a workflow. Simply create a workflow and add your node to it.

## Summary

- âœ… **Created a custom node** using the CLI.  
- âœ… **Configured the node class name** correctly.  
- âœ… **Registered the node** inside `Nodes.ts`.  
- âœ… **Validated the project setup**.

Your node is now ready to be used in workflows! ðŸŽ‰
