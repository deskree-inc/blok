- [ ] **Feature 2**: AI agents can generate TypeScript/Python nodes with proper Blok patterns
- [ ] **Feature 3**: AI agents can search and learn from blok.md documentation intelligently
- [ ] **Feature 4**: Comprehensive validation engine ensures quality before deployment
- [ ] **Feature 5**: Security middleware protects admin features with environment control
- [ ] **Feature 6**: AI Agent Guidance System provides step-by-step onboarding and discovery
- [ ] All new endpoints integrate seamlessly with existing MCP server architecture
- [ ] Production environments can disable admin features via ENABLE_MCP_ADMIN env var
- [ ] All generated content follows Blok framework standards and patterns

### Business Queries to Validate
1. "Can an AI agent with zero Blok knowledge use the guidance system to learn and create a complete user authentication workflow autonomously?"
2. "Can an AI agent discover existing nodes through the guidance system, understand their usage patterns, and integrate them correctly in new workflows?"
3. "Can an AI agent use the guidance system to make intelligent decisions about when to create new nodes vs use existing ones?"
4. "Can an AI agent generate a custom API integration node with proper error handling when no existing node meets requirements?"
5. "Can an AI agent navigate the complete workflow creation process from discovery to validation to deployment using the guidance system?"

### Implementation Notes

#### Architecture Integration
- Extends existing MCP server (triggers/mcp/) with new tool capabilities
- New endpoints implemented in HTTP trigger (triggers/http/) using HONO framework patterns
- Maintains current MCP Server → HTTP Client → Blok HTTP Trigger architecture
- All admin functionality controlled by HONO security middleware
- **CRITICAL**: Implementation must use HONO framework exclusively (NOT Express)
- HONO middleware for environment variable ENABLE_MCP_ADMIN control
- HONO route handlers for all /mcp/* admin endpoints

#### Technology Stack
- **MCP Server**: TypeScript with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **HTTP Trigger**: HONO framework (NOT Express) with existing HONO middleware patterns
- **Validation**: JSON Schema, TypeScript compiler, Python syntax validation
- **Documentation**: Markdown parsing with full-text search indexing
- **Security**: HONO middleware for environment variable control with minimal overhead

### Smoke Testing Protocol (MANDATORY - 100% Validation)
**CRITICAL**: This end-to-end smoke test MUST pass before considering the feature complete. It emulates a real AI agent creating a workflow from zero knowledge.

#### Test Scenario: "AI Agent Creates User Authentication Workflow"
**Goal**: AI agent with zero Blok knowledge creates a complete user authentication workflow

**Step 1: Agent Initialization & Learning**
```bash
# Agent calls MCP server to start learning process
MCP_CALL: guidance_start()
EXPECTED: Returns Blok framework overview, available endpoints, learning path
VALIDATION: Response contains framework basics, workflow concepts, next steps

MCP_CALL: docs_search("what is a workflow in blok")  
EXPECTED: Returns workflow structure, JSON format, basic examples
VALIDATION: Agent learns workflow anatomy (trigger, steps, nodes structure)
```

**Step 2: Node Discovery & Analysis**
```bash
# Agent discovers what nodes exist for authentication
MCP_CALL: guidance_nodes("authentication")
EXPECTED: Returns available auth-related nodes with usage patterns
VALIDATION: Agent finds existing nodes like user-validator, jwt-generator, etc.

MCP_CALL: docs_search("user authentication patterns")
EXPECTED: Returns authentication implementation examples from blok.md  
VALIDATION: Agent learns how to structure auth workflows
```

**Step 3: Intelligent Decision Making**
```bash
# Agent evaluates: use existing nodes or create new ones?
MCP_CALL: guidance_workflows("user login workflow requirements")
EXPECTED: Returns decision matrix: existing nodes vs new node creation
VALIDATION: Agent decides to use existing user-validator, create custom jwt-handler

# Agent gets specific node usage instructions
MCP_CALL: guidance_nodes("user-validator usage")
EXPECTED: Returns exact JSON configuration for user-validator node
VALIDATION: Agent understands how to configure existing node in workflow
```

**Step 4: Custom Node Creation (When Needed)**
```bash
# Agent learns how to create missing jwt-handler node
MCP_CALL: docs_search("creating typescript nodes")
EXPECTED: Returns node creation patterns, templates, code structure
VALIDATION: Agent understands NodeBlok class structure, schemas, error handling

MCP_CALL: nodes_validate({
  name: "jwt-handler",
  runtime: "typescript", 
  inputs: {email: "string", password: "string"},
  outputs: {token: "string", success: "boolean"}
})
EXPECTED: Returns validation result, suggests improvements if needed
VALIDATION: Node specification is valid before code generation
```

**Step 5: Workflow Creation & Validation**
```bash
# Agent creates complete workflow JSON
MCP_CALL: workflows_validate({
  name: "user-authentication",
  trigger: {http: {method: "POST", path: "/auth/login"}},
  steps: [
    {name: "validate-user", node: "user-validator", type: "local"},
    {name: "generate-token", node: "jwt-handler", type: "local"}
  ],
  nodes: {
    "validate-user": {inputs: {email: "${ctx.request.body.email}"}},
    "generate-token": {inputs: {user_id: "${ctx.vars['validate-user'].user_id}"}}
  }
})
EXPECTED: Returns validation result with specific errors/success
VALIDATION: Workflow JSON is syntactically correct and references valid nodes
```

**Step 6: Final Deployment & Execution Test**
```bash
# Agent creates workflow in filesystem
MCP_CALL: workflows_create({
  workflow_json: [validated_workflow_from_step5],
  save_path: "user-authentication.json"
})
EXPECTED: Returns success confirmation, file written to WORKFLOWS_PATH
VALIDATION: File exists at correct location, contains valid JSON

# CRITICAL: Execute created workflow to prove it works
MCP_CALL: workflow_execute("user-authentication", {
  request: {body: {email: "test@example.com", password: "testpass123"}}
})
EXPECTED: Returns successful execution result or specific error details
VALIDATION: Workflow executes without errors, returns expected response format
```

#### Smoke Test Acceptance Criteria (ALL MUST PASS)
- [ ] **Agent Learning**: AI agent successfully learns Blok basics in <5 MCP calls
- [ ] **Node Discovery**: AI agent finds and understands existing node usage patterns  
- [ ] **Decision Logic**: AI agent correctly decides when to use vs create nodes
- [ ] **Node Creation**: AI agent generates valid TypeScript node code when needed
- [ ] **Workflow Validation**: AI agent creates syntactically correct workflow JSON
- [ ] **File Operations**: Workflow/node files written to correct WORKFLOWS_PATH/NODES_PATH
- [ ] **Execution Proof**: Created workflow executes successfully with real test data
- [ ] **Error Handling**: AI agent receives helpful errors and can fix issues autonomously
- [ ] **Security**: All operations respect ENABLE_MCP_ADMIN environment variable
- [ ] **Performance**: Complete workflow creation process takes <2 minutes

#### Failure Scenarios (Must Handle Gracefully)
```bash
# Test security middleware
MCP_CALL: workflows_create() [with ENABLE_MCP_ADMIN=false]
EXPECTED: Returns 404 Not Found
VALIDATION: Admin features completely disabled in production

# Test validation errors
MCP_CALL: workflows_validate([invalid_workflow_json])
EXPECTED: Returns specific error messages with fix suggestions
VALIDATION: AI agent can understand and fix validation errors

# Test node reference errors  
MCP_CALL: workflows_validate([workflow_with_nonexistent_node])
EXPECTED: Returns "Node 'nonexistent-node' not found" with discovery suggestions
VALIDATION: AI agent learns about missing nodes and can create or find alternatives
```

### Success Validation
This task succeeds when AI agents can:
1. **Complete smoke test passes 100%** with real workflow creation and execution
2. Create complete, valid Blok workflows that execute successfully
3. Generate functional nodes that integrate seamlessly with existing workflows  
4. Learn from blok.md documentation to improve creation accuracy
5. Receive helpful validation feedback to fix issues autonomously
6. Operate safely in production environments with proper security controls

**Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for complete implementation and testing
**Priority**: P0 (Critical) - Enables autonomous AI development capabilities
**Dependencies**: Requires access to existing MCP server, HTTP trigger, and blok.md documentation
