title: runner
---

`runner` is an execution engine designed to process nanoservice-based workflows efficiently. It provides a structured way to execute nanoservices within a defined workflow, enabling modular, reusable backend logic.

## Relationship to the rest of the project
<Tip> For a complete reference visit [runner](/docs/ref/runner/src/README)</Tip>
Runner is responsibly for reading workflow files and executing provided nodes based on the selected trigger. Think about it as a conductor that orchestrates the execution of nanoservices. 

In addition, it also tracks important parameters and metrics during the workflow execution that can be used for debugging and [monitoring purposes](/docs/d/advanced/monitoring-obserbvability).

## **Guide to Contributing to the Runner in Nanoservice-TS**

<Tip> Make sure you follow the recommendations on how to set up local environment and steps to complete before committing your changes. To learn more [visit](/docs/c/overview/how-to-contribute)</Tip>

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deskree-inc/nanoservice-ts.git
cd nanoservice-ts/core/runner
npm install
```

### **2. Run the Runner Locally**  
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Runner in **development mode**, allowing you to test changes in real-time.

### **Understanding the Runner**  
The Runner is responsible for:  
âœ… **Executing nanoservices** in an isolated environment.  
âœ… **Managing resource allocation** (CPU, memory).  
âœ… **Handling retries, error logging, and state management.**

### **Adding Features or Fixing Bugs**
#### **1. Create a Feature Branch**  
```bash
git checkout -b feature/improve-runner-logging
```

#### **2. Make Your Changes**
Modify the relevant files inside `/core/runner/src/`.  
Example: **Improving logging in `executor.ts`**  
```typescript
import { logInfo } from './logger';

async function executeNode(node: NodeConfig) {
  logInfo(`Executing node: ${node.id} (${node.type})`);
  // Execution logic...
}
```

#### **3. Test Your Changes**  
Run unit tests:  
```bash
npm test
```
Manually test with:  
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### **4. Submit a Pull Request**
Push your changes and open a PR on GitHub.  
```bash
git push origin feature/improve-runner-logging
```
In the PR description, include:  
- **What was changed?**  
- **Why was it changed?**  
- **How was it tested?**  

---

### **Best Practices**
âœ… Keep functions modular and reusable.  
âœ… Write **unit tests** for new features.  
âœ… Use **consistent logging** for observability.  
âœ… Ensure changes do not break existing workflows.
