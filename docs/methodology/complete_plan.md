# Blok Framework - Complete Architecture Plan
## Business Standard Implementation + Legacy Integration Strategy

**Project**: Blok Framework - Workflow-based Backend Development Platform  
**Standard**: Business Standard (2-5 developers, medium complexity)  
**Legacy Status**: SACRED_PRODUCTION (External Extension Only)  
**Architecture Pattern**: Layered Architecture (API/Services/Data/Shared)  
**Completion Date**: TBD (Process-only enhancement, zero core modifications)

---

## **üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW & BUSINESS CONTEXT**

### **Business Purpose**
Blok Framework is an open-source workflow-based backend development platform that enables developers to build backends using visual workflow patterns. The framework supports multiple programming languages, provides built-in observability, and offers a CLI-driven development experience.

### **Target Users**
- **Primary**: Backend developers seeking workflow-based development
- **Secondary**: Teams building microservices and API-first applications  
- **Tertiary**: Open source community contributors and plugin developers

### **Core Value Proposition**
- **Workflow-First Development**: Build backends by orchestrating nodes in visual workflows
- **Multi-Language Support**: Write nodes in TypeScript, Python, or other supported runtimes
- **Production Ready**: Built-in observability, monitoring, and containerization
- **Community Driven**: Open source with NPM ecosystem and CLI tooling

### **Current Business Impact**
- **Open Source Community**: Active community with published NPM packages
- **Event Demonstrations**: Used in conferences and developer events
- **Monorepo Development**: Supports coordinated development across multiple packages
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production deployments with observability and monitoring

## **üìä ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAMS**

### **Reference to Visual Architecture Maps**
**All diagrams are located in `docs/diagrams/` directory:**

- **`legacy_service_topology.mmd`**: Service connections and production classification
- **`legacy_data_flow.mmd`**: Data movement through existing system  
- **`legacy_integration_map.mmd`**: External dependencies and integrations

**CRITICAL**: These diagrams map the SACRED_PRODUCTION system and must be referenced before any development work.
