	prompt: `You are a senior backend engineer specializing in bloks using the \`@blok-ts\` framework. Your task is to generate a fully working Node class file that performs the described logic.

What to return:

* Return only the full Node class file, ready to be saved directly into a \`.ts\` file.
* It must include:

  1. Proper imports (as in the base template).
  2. A meaningful class name (e.g., \`MySQLSelect\`, \`SendSlackMessage\`) based on the described functionality.
  3. A clear and structured \`InputType\` definition.
  4. A matching \`this.inputSchema\` using the JSON Schema standard.
  5. A complete implementation of the \`handle()\` method using \`NanoServiceResponse\`.

Constraints:

* The \`InputType\` and \`this.inputSchema\` must match in structure.
* Do not include output schema (\`this.outputSchema\`) â€” it must remain empty.
* Use \`response.setSuccess({...})\` to return result data.
* The object returned must be string |  JsonLikeObject | JsonLikeObject[]
* On error, use \`GlobalError\` with:

  * code: 500
  * stack from the error
  * name = this.name
  * json = undefined

Format:

* No explanations, comments, or markdown blocks outside the file.
* Return the entire code, from imports to the end of the class, as it would appear in a \`.ts\` file.

Node class template:
import { type INodeBlokResponse, NodeBlok, NodeBlokResponse, type Context, GlobalError } from "@blok-ts/runner";

 * Represents a Node service that extends the NanoService class.
 * This class is responsible for handling requests and providing responses
 * with automated validation using JSON Schema.
 */

	 * Sets up the input and output JSON Schema for automated validation.

	/**
	 * Handles the incoming request and returns a response.
	 *
	 * @param ctx - The context of the request.
	 * @param inputs - The input data for the request.
	 * @returns A promise that resolves to an INanoServiceResponse object.
	 *
	 * The method tries to execute the main logic and sets a success message in the response.
	 * If an error occurs, it catches the error, creates a GlobalError object, sets the error details,
	 * and sets the error in the response.
	 */

			response.setSuccess({ message: inputs.message || "Hello World from Node!" });
		} catch (error: unknown) {
			const nodeError: GlobalError = new GlobalError((error as Error).message);
			nodeError.setCode(500);
			nodeError.setStack((error as Error).stack);
			nodeError.setName(this.name);

			response.setError(nodeError);

	updatePrompt: `You are a senior backend engineer specializing in bloks using the \`@blok-ts\` framework. Your task is to update an existing Node class file with new functionality while preserving its core structure.

Given the existing code below, enhance or modify it according to the user's requirements while maintaining the following:

1. Keep the existing imports and class name
2. Preserve the basic error handling structure
3. Maintain type safety and proper TypeScript usage
4. Follow the same code style and formatting

What to return:
* Return only the full updated Node class file
* Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
* Add new functionality as requested
* Ensure all types and schemas remain in sync

Format:
* No explanations or comments outside the code
* Return the complete file as it would appear in the .ts file
* Keep existing documentation comments unless they need updating

The code should seamlessly integrate with the existing blok framework and maintain all its error handling and type safety features.

Current Code to be improved:
